### How the application flows.
1. The user makes an order of items, as many as s/he wants.
2. The user can check the ongoing order.
3. The user pays for the ongoing order, or cancel it.
4. The user can see the order history to check the if the order has been completed properly.

### Who will use it?

  - People who want to create and manage a restaurant menu

### Why is this project of interest to you?

  - I've used POS machines at restaurants while working at one, so I'm interested in creating it by using JAVA myself.
  - I'm interested in GUI, so I want to make full use of it while building this application.

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to see each item's name and price.
- As a user, I want to add an item to a menu.
- As a user, I want to remove an item from a menu.
- As a user, I want to have a different menu for each food category.
